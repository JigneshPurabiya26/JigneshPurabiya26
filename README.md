Data Engineer
-------------
I'm a **Data Engineer with 2.5+ years of hands-on experience**, passionate about turning raw data into reliable, scalable data products.  
After exploring web development, Android, and core software engineering, I found my true calling in **data engineering** — where data, systems, and real-world impact intersect.

What pulled me in?  
👉 **Sports + Data.**  
The way data can uncover hidden patterns behind performances, strategies, and outcomes fascinated me. That curiosity pushed me deep into data pipelines, distributed systems, and cloud platforms.

Today, I focus on **designing end-to-end data pipelines**, ensuring data is **accurate, scalable, and analytics-ready**.
