Data Engineer
-------------

I've been coding for two years now and has been exploring different domains like Web development, android development, software engineering, and finally data science. Out of all these domains data science allured me in such a way that I got completely hooked onto it. The reason I got hooked onto it was, because I realized, I can use data science as a way to stay connected to my passion which is sports. This is because sports is not only what we see on the field is a lot more than that. The way data scientists perform analysis on the past data and provide us analysis is just mind blowing. The way we can perform innumerable and exciting tasks using data just fascinated me. It is the reason I choose to become a data engineer and explored a lot of sub-domains for instance machine learning, NLP, data analysis using Tableau, mySql, and just touched upon deep learning but, yet I feel there is a plethora of sub-domains to be explored and exploited, and I am up for it.
